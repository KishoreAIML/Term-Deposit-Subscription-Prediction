# Bank Marketing Prediction

This project is based on the **direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution**. The marketing campaigns were conducted through phone calls. Often, more than one contact with the same client was required in order to determine whether they would subscribe to the bank's term deposit product.

The objective of this project is to build a **machine learning model** that can predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit (`yes` or `no`) based on the given features.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

- **Source**: [UCI Machine Learning Repository â€“ Bank Marketing Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing)  
- **Number of records**: ~41,000  
- **Features**:  
  - Client attributes: age, job, marital status, education, default, balance, housing loan, personal loan  
  - Contact attributes: contact type, last contact month/day, duration, campaign calls, previous contacts  
  - Outcome of previous marketing campaign  
- **Target variable**: `y` â†’ Whether the client subscribed to a term deposit (`yes` or `no`)
